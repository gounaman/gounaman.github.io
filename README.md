SVG animations of Islamic design motifs

This repository will contain a series of SVG animations of Islamic-themed designs.
Many -- but not all -- of these designs will be geometric.
Most will be inspired by well known designs that can be found in major Islamic cultural sites around the world.

The goal of this repository is to push SVG animation to the limit, using increasingly complex HTML/CSS/SVG code blocks.
Initially, these animated design blocks will use Pure CSS only.
JS libraries such as SNAP.svg (http://snapsvg.io/) will be made use of later on, as the animation become increasingly complex.
