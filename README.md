SVG animations of Islamic design motifs

This repository will (ie 2022) contain a series of SVG animations of Islamic-themed designs.
Many -- but not all -- of these designs will be geometric.
Most will be inspired by well known designs that can be found in major Islamic cultural sites around the world. Some will be just playing around stuff, usually to test JS->SVG DOM snippets.
