SVG animations of Islamic design motifs

This repository will contain a series of SVG animations of Islamic-themed designs.
Many -- but not all -- of these designs will be geometric.
Most will be inspired by well known designs that can be found in major Islamic cultural sites around the world. Some will be just playing around stuff, usually to test JS->SVG DOM snippets.

This is the work of Gounaman. You are free to use whCSS/SVG code blocks.
Initially, these animated design blocks will use Pure CSS only.
JS libraries such as SNAP.svg (http://snapsvg.io/) will be made use of later on, as thatever you think is worth building on, but please respect the GPL license.
